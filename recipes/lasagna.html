    <h2>Easiest home made lasagnas</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>5 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
        <li>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</li>
        <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 375Â°F and assemble the lasagna</li>

    </ol>
